modified activity 3 to fit requirements for 4

Modify last exercise by adding escape sequence. 
Escape sequences allow you to include special characters within strings and control the formatting of your text. They are particularly useful when you need to include characters that would otherwise have a special meaning in a string, such as quotes or newline characters.
